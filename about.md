# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Carl Aslund, an aspiring software engineering study Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. I made this website to display some of my programming side-projects, but I'm also writing a small blog with a few of my random thoughts. Some of the posts will be about my coding, but expect plenty of other content relating to various odd interests, such as my pleasure reading. I might even throw in some writing about politics, philosophy, soccer, or some miscellaneous topic that happens to come to mind.

I hope you enjoy looking around at the projects and blog posts hosted here, and feel free to contact me if you so desire!

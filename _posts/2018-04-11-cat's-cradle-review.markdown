In *Cat's Cradle*, Kurt Vonnegut presents a story including a fabricated religion (Bokononism), an impoverished Caribbean dictatorship (San Lorenzo), and the family and work of a fictional father of the atom bomb (Felix Hoenikker).

The book starts off rather tame, with the narrator seeking to learn more about the now-dead Hoenikker from the children he left behind. However, as the plot develops, both the narrator and the Hoenikker children find themselves gathered on San Lorenzo, a nation built upon an utterly unusable island. As the main characters explore the island state and the outlawed religion that every citizen follows, building up to an apocalyptic event, courtesy of Felix Hoenikker's last creation.

Tales involving the apocalypse usually are treated as a tragic affair, but Vonnegut refuses to do so, instead using his wonderfully dry humor to mock as many subjects as possible. Over the course of the novel, he manages to ridicule romantic desires, blind faith in either religion or science, the tendency of scientists to pursue technological advancement recklessly, patriotism/nationalism, and a slew of other targets. The social commentary provided through Vonnegut's jibes are worth considering, but even without dwelling on any deeper meaning, the book was fun on its own, and I found myself laughing regularly while reading. For those reasons, I strongly recommend reading it, and I personally intend to explore some more of Kurt Vonnegut's writing.

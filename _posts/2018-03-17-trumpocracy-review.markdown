David Frum's *Trumpocracy* takes a look Donald Trump's first year as president and the events leading up to it. In it, he discusses why his administration is not only problematic in the short term, but is also a sign of deeper issues lying beneath the surface in American politics. He points to many contributing causes, such as the escalating partisanship and disrespect for governing norms on both sides of the aisle, along with a failure to identity the troubles ailing rural Americans.

Frum later moves on to show how Trump has abused all of these problems, and how his dismissal of presidential custom, his engagement in corruption relating to foreign agents and his business ventures serve to make things worse. Trump is not the only one blamed in the current state of affairs, as Frum offers plenty of criticism for the congressmen refusing to counter the president's actions, and especially Fox News and other sources of fraudulent news for misleading the public.

The book does not provide any bombshell exclusives, unlike some of the competing books about Trump's administration (see *Fire and Fury*), and just about every event Frum references has at some point popped up in my news feed over the past couple years. However, what Frum does masterfully is use all of those moments and piece them together to present a narrative. During the constant barrage of news cycle after news cycle over the past couple years, it can be hard to keep track of everything and understand what it all means.

For all the negativity, Frum manages to end on a positive note, by noting that the portion of the public in support of Trump is a shrinking minority of the population. He therefore argues that if the rest of the population embraces their civic duty and use their voting power to protect democracy, it can be saved from what he refers to as "Trumpocracy." The ending felt a bit too idealistic for me, and I would've preferred some more concrete goals for what can be done to combat the current state of affairs. Even so, *Trumpocracy* is worth reading for the way it effectively summarizes what has been a remarkably chaotic presidency, especially for any readers who are curious about what big revelations they might have missed in one of many chaotic weeks.

Stefan Szymanski's *Money and Soccer: A Soccernomics Guide* presents a thorough analysis into how the finances and results of a club influence each other, dissecting various topics within the matter to provide valuable conclusions. The book reads a bit like a series of papers on the matter strung together, so the reading could get a bit dry, but with each chapter came an interesting observation into the world of soccer finances.

To begin, Szymanski drew comparisons between two leagues of highly different calibers, Spain's La Liga (\#1 in UEFA club coefficient rankings), and the less notable Faroe Islands Premier League (\#51 out of 55 in UEFA club coefficient rankings). The former is recognized as the best league in the world and accordingly possesses a worldwide following, while many soccer fans would be surprised to learn that a Danish autonomous territory with 50,000 inhabitants even has a league.

In spite of all that, both leagues have similar outcomes, with only a stratified handful of top teams that can realistically hope to win. After this initial observation, Szymanski proceeds to take a look at many other subjects within finance, examining why debt rarely destroys a club, how much clubs need to spend to be competitive, and why a handful of teams tend to stay at the top. Each of the conclusions he determines are valuable, and all of them are also depicted in an easy-digestible graphical format. For that reason, if the intersection of soccer and finance interests you, this is a fantastic book to read.

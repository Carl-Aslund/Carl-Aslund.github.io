The original plan was to write this website with Jekyll's minima theme as a base, since Jekyll's focus on blogging and GitHub support made it ideal for my purposes. However, since this is my first effort at coding a full website, I decided to go with an elaborate site template to get myself started. To that end, after what was probably far too much time spent browsing [free-css.com](http://www.free-css.com/), and eventually decided to go with the [Stanley](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page202/stanley) template.

After spending the past couple days wrestling with the template, I'm a bit less convinced by Stanley. The initial template definitely looks nice, but the template's CSS stylesheet contains no less than 7118 lines, many of which have a rather high priority that has interfered with my own styling. Also, while the use of Bootstrap to introduce mobile compatibility is nice, it adds a lot of complexity for a first site. To that end, while I intend to take the Stanley template as an inspiration, I have decided that I should be writing the site from the bottom up rather than starting with the template. Hopefully this choice works out!

*The Little Prince* has certainly been the odd book out in my recent reading, as it was rather short at only 133 sparsely-filled pages with plenty of illustrations, and the vocabulary was quite elementary. In fact, throughout the entire book, there was only a single word that an eight-year-old wouldn't know, and that particular word is defined repeatedly for good measure.

Taking everything into consideration, an eight-year-old could probably read this book without much trouble, and I'd guess that they would enjoy it too, but the story has plenty of value for older readers. At a first look, *The Little Prince* masquerades as a children's book, with its fantastical idea of space, its watercolor pictures, and the advice bestowed upon the main character by a talking animals. However, the story itself focuses on the wonders of looking at the world from a child's perspective, a particularly useful lesson for adults who happen to pick up the book.

In the novella, a little man of unknown age departs his home asteroid in search of answers, and travels from planet to planet in search of answers. When visiting asteroid-sized planets early in his journey, he encounters many adults, including a king, a businessman, a geographer, and more. The people he encounters all claim to have some important task or knowledge, but through the eyes of the little prince, their tasks seem pointless, and their knowledge is not very helpful. Instead, by harnessing his curiosity, he finds wisdom by looking to unorthodox sources, such as roses, foxes, and a stranger he finds in the middle of a desert.

If you want a book to read to your child, this would be a good choice purely due to its surface value, but I would recommend *The Little Prince* more strongly to older readers. Give it a try, and remember how it felt to be a child, free of any boring tasks, with all the time in the world to understand everything around you.
